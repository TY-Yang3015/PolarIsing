### Polaris 0.5.0

This is a **crucial major update**.

- The 'beyond' support for conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is now available. 
- The interface of the module has been **significantly redesigned**, the previous routine and documentation **no longer works**. 

Please see the **documentation** for detailed instruction. 

since the file is ~2 GB, github doesn't support that size anymore. Please download it directly from my GoogleDrive.
